# Token Efficiency Improvements Summary

## Overview
Made all MCP tool descriptions concise and token-efficient while preserving essential information.

## Key Improvements

### Before vs After Examples

1. **search_nodes**
   - Before: ~350 chars with verbose explanation
   - After: 165 chars
   - `Search nodes by keywords. Modes: OR (any word), AND (all words), FUZZY (typos OK). Primary nodes ranked first. Examples: "webhook"→Webhook, "http call"→HTTP Request.`

2. **get_node_info**
   - Before: ~450 chars with warnings about size
   - After: 174 chars
   - `Get FULL node schema (100KB+). TIP: Use get_node_essentials first! Returns all properties/operations/credentials. Prefix required: "nodes-base.httpRequest" not "httpRequest".`

3. **validate_node_minimal**
   - Before: ~350 chars explaining what it doesn't do
   - After: 102 chars
   - `Fast check for missing required fields only. No warnings/suggestions. Returns: list of missing fields.`

4. **get_property_dependencies**
   - Before: ~400 chars with full example
   - After: 131 chars
   - `Shows property dependencies and visibility rules. Example: sendBody=true reveals body fields. Test visibility with optional config.`

## Statistics

### Documentation Tools (22 tools)
- Average description length: **129 characters**
- Total characters: 2,836
- Tools over 200 chars: 1 (list_nodes at 204)

### Management Tools (17 tools)
- Average description length: **93 characters**
- Total characters: 1,578
- Tools over 200 chars: 1 (n8n_update_partial_workflow at 284)

## Strategy Used

1. **Remove redundancy**: Eliminated repeated information available in parameter descriptions
2. **Use abbreviations**: "vs" instead of "versus", "&" instead of "and" where appropriate
3. **Compact examples**: `"webhook"→Webhook` instead of verbose explanations
4. **Direct language**: "Fast check" instead of "Quick validation that only checks"
5. **Move details to documentation**: Complex tools reference `tools_documentation()` for full details
6. **Essential info only**: Focus on what the tool does, not how it works internally

## Special Cases

### n8n_update_partial_workflow
This tool's description is necessarily longer (284 chars) because:
- Lists all 13 operation types
- Critical for users to know available operations
- Directs to full documentation for details

### Complex Documentation Preserved
For tools like `n8n_update_partial_workflow`, detailed documentation was moved to `tools-documentation.ts` rather than deleted, ensuring users can still access comprehensive information when needed.

## Impact
- **Token savings**: ~65-70% reduction in description tokens
- **Faster AI responses**: Less context used for tool descriptions
- **Better UX**: Clearer, more scannable tool list
- **Maintained functionality**: All essential information preserved
