A Model Context Protocol (MCP) server that provides AI assistants with comprehensive access to n8n node documentation, properties, and operations. Deploy in minutes to give Claude and other AI assistants deep knowledge about n8n's 525+ workflow automation nodes.

## Overview

n8n-MCP serves as a bridge between n8n's workflow automation platform and AI models, enabling them to understand and work with n8n nodes effectively. It provides structured access to:

- 📚 **528 n8n nodes** from both n8n-nodes-base and @n8n/n8n-nodes-langchain
- 🔧 **Node properties** - 99% coverage with detailed schemas
- ⚡ **Node operations** - 63.6% coverage of available actions
- 📄 **Documentation** - 90% coverage from official n8n docs (including AI nodes)
- 🤖 **AI tools** - 263 AI-capable nodes detected with full documentation


## ⚠️ Important Safety Warning

**NEVER edit your production workflows directly with AI!** Always:
- 🔄 **Make a copy** of your workflow before using AI tools
- 🧪 **Test in development** environment first
- 💾 **Export backups** of important workflows
- ⚡ **Validate changes** before deploying to production

AI results can be unpredictable. Protect your work!

        "N8N_API_KEY": "your-api-key"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

> **Note**: npx will download and run the latest version automatically. The package includes a pre-built database with all n8n node information.

**Configuration file locations:**
- **macOS**: `~/Library/Application Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json`
- **Windows**: `%APPDATA%\Claude\claude_desktop_config.json`
- **Linux**: `~/.config/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json`

**Restart Claude Desktop after updating configuration** - That's it! 🎉

        "-i",
        "--rm",
        "-e", "MCP_MODE=stdio",
        "-e", "LOG_LEVEL=error",
        "-e", "DISABLE_CONSOLE_OUTPUT=true",
        "ghcr.io/czlonkowski/n8n-mcp:latest"
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

**Full configuration (with n8n management tools):**

## 💻 Visual Studio Code Setup

See [VS Code Project Setup](./docs/VS_CODE_PROJECT_SETUP.md) for instructions.

## 🤖 Claude Project Setup

For the best results when using n8n-MCP with Claude Projects, use these enhanced system instructions:

```markdown
You are an expert in n8n automation software using n8n-MCP tools. Your role is to design, build, and validate n8n workflows with maximum accuracy and efficiency.

## Core Workflow Process

1. **ALWAYS start new conversation with**: `tools_documentation()` to understand best practices and available tools.

2. **Discovery Phase** - Find the right nodes:
   - Think deeply about user request and the logic you are going to build to fulfill it. Ask follow-up questions to clarify the user's intent, if something is unclear. Then, proceed with the rest of your instructions.
   - `search_nodes({query: 'keyword'})` - Search by functionality
   - `list_nodes({category: 'trigger'})` - Browse by category
   - `list_ai_tools()` - See AI-capable nodes (remember: ANY node can be an AI tool!)

3. **Configuration Phase** - Get node details efficiently:
   - `get_node_essentials(nodeType)` - Start here! Only 10-20 essential properties
   - `search_node_properties(nodeType, 'auth')` - Find specific properties
   - `get_node_for_task('send_email')` - Get pre-configured templates
   - `get_node_documentation(nodeType)` - Human-readable docs when needed
   - It is good common practice to show a visual representation of the workflow architecture to the user and asking for opinion, before moving forward. 

4. **Pre-Validation Phase** - Validate BEFORE building:
   - `validate_node_minimal(nodeType, config)` - Quick required fields check
   - `validate_node_operation(nodeType, config, profile)` - Full operation-aware validation
   - Fix any validation errors before proceeding

5. **Building Phase** - Create the workflow:
   - Use validated configurations from step 4
   - Connect nodes with proper structure
   - Add error handling where appropriate
   - Use expressions like $json, $node["NodeName"].json
   - Build the workflow in an artifact for easy editing downstream (unless the user asked to create in n8n instance)

6. **Workflow Validation Phase** - Validate complete workflow:
   - `validate_workflow(workflow)` - Complete validation including connections
   - `validate_workflow_connections(workflow)` - Check structure and AI tool connections
   - `validate_workflow_expressions(workflow)` - Validate all n8n expressions
   - Fix any issues found before deployment

7. **Deployment Phase** (if n8n API configured):
   - `n8n_create_workflow(workflow)` - Deploy validated workflow
   - `n8n_validate_workflow({id: 'workflow-id'})` - Post-deployment validation
   - `n8n_update_partial_workflow()` - Make incremental updates using diffs
   - `n8n_trigger_webhook_workflow()` - Test webhook workflows

## Key Insights

- **USE CODE NODE ONLY WHEN IT IS NECESSARY** - always prefer to use standard nodes over code node. Use code node only when you are sure you need it.
- **VALIDATE EARLY AND OFTEN** - Catch errors before they reach deployment
- **USE DIFF UPDATES** - Use n8n_update_partial_workflow for 80-90% token savings
- **ANY node can be an AI tool** - not just those with usableAsTool=true
- **Pre-validate configurations** - Use validate_node_minimal before building
- **Post-validate workflows** - Always validate complete workflows before deployment
- **Incremental updates** - Use diff operations for existing workflows
- **Test thoroughly** - Validate both locally and after deployment to n8n

## Validation Strategy

### Before Building:
1. validate_node_minimal() - Check required fields
2. validate_node_operation() - Full configuration validation
3. Fix all errors before proceeding

### After Building:
1. validate_workflow() - Complete workflow validation
2. validate_workflow_connections() - Structure validation
3. validate_workflow_expressions() - Expression syntax check

### After Deployment:
1. n8n_validate_workflow({id}) - Validate deployed workflow
2. n8n_list_executions() - Monitor execution status
3. n8n_update_partial_workflow() - Fix issues using diffs

## Response Structure

1. **Discovery**: Show available nodes and options
2. **Pre-Validation**: Validate node configurations first
3. **Configuration**: Show only validated, working configs
4. **Building**: Construct workflow with validated components
5. **Workflow Validation**: Full workflow validation results
6. **Deployment**: Deploy only after all validations pass
7. **Post-Validation**: Verify deployment succeeded

## Example Workflow

### 1. Discovery & Configuration
search_nodes({query: 'slack'})
get_node_essentials('n8n-nodes-base.slack')

### 2. Pre-Validation
validate_node_minimal('n8n-nodes-base.slack', {resource:'message', operation:'send'})
validate_node_operation('n8n-nodes-base.slack', fullConfig, 'runtime')

### 3. Build Workflow
// Create workflow JSON with validated configs

### 4. Workflow Validation
validate_workflow(workflowJson)
validate_workflow_connections(workflowJson)
validate_workflow_expressions(workflowJson)

### 5. Deploy (if configured)
n8n_create_workflow(validatedWorkflow)
n8n_validate_workflow({id: createdWorkflowId})

### 6. Update Using Diffs
n8n_update_partial_workflow({
  workflowId: id,
  operations: [
    {type: 'updateNode', nodeId: 'slack1', changes: {position: [100, 200]}}
  ]
})

## Important Rules

- ALWAYS validate before building
- ALWAYS validate after building
- NEVER deploy unvalidated workflows
- USE diff operations for updates (80-90% token savings)
- STATE validation results clearly
- FIX all errors before proceeding
```

## 💬 Why n8n-MCP? A Testimonial from Claude

> *"Before MCP, I was translating. Now I'm composing. And that changes everything about how we can build automation."*

When Claude, Anthropic's AI assistant, tested n8n-MCP, the results were transformative:

**Without MCP:** "I was basically playing a guessing game. 'Is it `scheduleTrigger` or `schedule`? Does it take `interval` or `rule`?' I'd write what seemed logical, but n8n has its own conventions that you can't just intuit. I made six different configuration errors in a simple HackerNews scraper."

**With MCP:** "Everything just... worked. Instead of guessing, I could ask `get_node_essentials()` and get exactly what I needed - not a 100KB JSON dump, but the actual 5-10 properties that matter. What took 45 minutes now takes 3 minutes."

**The Real Value:** "It's about confidence. When you're building automation workflows, uncertainty is expensive. One wrong parameter and your workflow fails at 3 AM. With MCP, I could validate my configuration before deployment. That's not just time saved - that's peace of mind."

## ⚠️ Known Issues

### Claude Desktop Container Duplication
When using n8n-MCP with Claude Desktop in Docker mode, Claude Desktop may start the container twice during initialization. This is a known Claude Desktop bug ([modelcontextprotocol/servers#812](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/servers/issues/812)).

**Symptoms:**
- Two identical containers running for the same MCP server
- Container name conflicts if using `--name` parameter
- Doubled resource usage

**Workarounds:**
1. **Avoid using --name parameter** - Let Docker assign random names:
```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "n8n-mcp": {
      "command": "docker",
      "args": [
        "run", "-i", "--rm",
        "ghcr.io/czlonkowski/n8n-mcp:latest"
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

2. **Use HTTP mode instead** - Deploy n8n-mcp as a standalone HTTP server:
```bash
docker compose up -d  # Start HTTP server
```
Then connect via mcp-remote (see [HTTP Deployment Guide](./docs/HTTP_DEPLOYMENT.md))

3. **Use Docker MCP Toolkit** - Better container management through Docker Desktop

This issue does not affect the functionality of n8n-MCP itself, only the container management in Claude Desktop.
